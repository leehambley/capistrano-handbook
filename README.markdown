Capistrano Handbook
===================

This is the Capistrano handbook, designed to lower the barrier of entry for all would-be Capistrano users who have struggled to find documentation in the past.

> Unfortunately with no community contributions, and no free time I
lost interest in writing the handbook. Sorry! It remains now only in the
hope that some people will find some value in it.

After seen there are people who find some value.. I'm thinking about a way to lower the barrier and continue to work on the pages in the [capistrano-handbook](https://github.com/stefanooldeman/capistrano-handbook/wiki/_pages). 
The first step towards this made today. I've moved capistrano-handbook into a [wiki](https://github.com/stefanooldeman/capistrano-handbook/wiki/Index) to fix the broken links and let others easily edit pages.

To help and collaborate, [read about](https://github.com/stefanooldeman/capistrano-handbook/wiki/_access) how to clone the wiki with git. You can also contribute trough githubs wiki interface

Thanks allot to @leemhambley and all the other contributors.
